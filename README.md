The first thing I did was include the libraries for the file i/o (fstream) and strings (string). 

Then I initialized and defined a class with the name Item. I then made two void functions that would be called in the main function. 

The first void function would save the item to the file which the second void function would then read. 

Both functions would then cout that the item was saved and the contents of the file or an error if it didn't work. 

In my main function at the bottom, I created an Item object and assigned a name and quantity to it. I then called both the void functions which first wrote the tool name and quantity into the file then read and cout said info.
