I created a menu in the void function that I called from my main function. 

The reason why I put the void function first is because the compiler reads starting from the top. 

If I had my main function first and called the void function after, without defining or initializing it, there would be an error.

Then, I made a do while loop, where as long as the condition (option does not equal 3) is true, the loop will continue. 

Additionally, in my code I added an if-statement in the do-while loop to remind the user to input a number between 1-3.
